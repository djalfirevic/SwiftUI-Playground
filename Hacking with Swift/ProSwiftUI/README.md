# Hello!

This project is designed to demonstrate the code from my book Pro SwiftUI.
If you run the app you'll see the same sections and chapters from the book,
although some are broken down into multiple screens because they demonstrate
specific variations of the code. 

I've used extensions as much as possible for the various pieces of example
code, because having so many overlapping code samples would cause
chaos otherwise.

Putting aside the code for this book, the code for this project *might*
prove interesting given that the whole thing is powered through JSON.
If you're curious how it's accomplished, see Book.swift!

This app requires Xcode 14 or later, using the iOS 16 or later simulator.
